### About Me

I am an end-to-end Data Scientist with a versatile skill set that spans statistical analysis, data modeling, machine learning, and modern data engineering. I am passionate about working across the full data lifecycle: from ingestion and transformation to modeling, deployment, and insight.

My work is driven by a passion for uncovering patterns in complex data and building systems that scale. While I continue to deepen my skills in data infrastructure and engineering, I remain committed to asking and answering novel questions through advanced data mining techniques.

To learn more about me or get in touch, please contact me through email or connect with me on LinkedIn.
